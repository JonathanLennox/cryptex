--- abstract

While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) protects the contents of a media packet from eavesdroppers, a significant amount of metadata is still visible in the form of RTP header extensions and contributing sources (CSRCs). Previous approaches to protect this data have had limited deployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations. This document proposes a new mechanism to completely encrypt header extensions and CSRCs with a new signaling mechanism to facilitate deployment.
